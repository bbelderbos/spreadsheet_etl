## Spreadsheet ETL ##

## A work in progress. Implements a pipeline that extracts data from a .csv file, transforms it into a database-friendly format, and loads it into a PostgreSQL db. ##

I'm writing Spreadsheet ETL to help me learn about concurrency in Python, experiment with different programming techniques, and work on unit testing and code testability.

As of 2017-04-21, Spreadsheet ETL is no longer in the early stages of development. Its Extract, Transform, and Load modules have been implemented and are fully functional.
