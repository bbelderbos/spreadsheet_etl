## Spreadsheet ETL ##

#### I built this to keep track of my sleep pattern; it turned into something more. ####

Spreadsheet ETL now implements a pipeline that extracts data from a .csv file, transforms the data into a database-friendly format, and loads it into a PostgreSQL db.

It's letting me experiment with concurrency and other programming techniques in Python, and work on unit testing and code testability.

As of 2017-05-08, Spreadsheet ETL's Extract, Transform, and Load modules all work; but some important features remain to be implemented.
