## Spreadsheet ETL ##

#### I'm writing Spreadsheet ETL to help me learn about concurrency in Python, experiment with different programming techniques (such as using functions instead of classes, writing closures, etc.), and work on unit testing and testability. ####

As of 2017-04-12, Spreadsheet ETL is no longer in the early stages of development. The Extract and Transform modules have been implemented and the Load unit is progressing nicely.
