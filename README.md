## Spreadsheet ETL ##

#### I'm writing Spreadsheet ETL to help me learn about concurrency in Python, experiment with different programming techniques (such as using functions instead of classes, writing closures, etc.), and work on unit testing and testability. ####

It is no longer in the earliest stages of development; the Extract and Transform modules have been implemented and the groundwork has been set up to create the Load unit.
