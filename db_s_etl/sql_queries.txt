    Might need:
        a "night" table with a 'night_id', a 'start_date', a 'start_time' and [(possibly) a 'duration' interval PROBABLY NOT]
            -- how to calculate 'duration' ? 
        a "nap" table with a 'start_time' and a 'duration' interval AND a
            'night_id' foreign key referencing 'night.night_id'
        
    Q: store the ttl hrs slept in the previous night in the db or calculate it in db or calculate it in app ?

            SELECT night.night_id, SUM(sleep.duration)
            FROM night INNER JOIN sleep ON sleep.night_id = night.night_id
